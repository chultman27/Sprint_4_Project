    "## Sprint 4 Project: UFO/UAP Sighting Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to creat a web application exploring some basic trends regarding global UFO sightings from 1910 to 2014. This data set was obtained from : https://mavenanalytics.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "UFO (unidentified flying objects) or UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena) as the are now called are terms used to describe \"any apparent object in the sky that canâ€™t be identified and classified as an object or phenomenon already known\" (Petrescu, 1). While some of these can be accredited to phenomena such as weather balloons or aircrafts, others are harder to explain by conventional means. These sightings are often linked to extraterrestrials and alien life. While this topic is controversial and discussion is widespread even throughout the United States government, data does exist to support the existence of UAPs and patterns in the experiences seen. \n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to:\n",
    "Identify potential patterns in UAP sightings such as:\n",
    "1. Places with high numbers of sightings\n",
    "2. Years/ times of the year when sightings are high\n",
    "3. Patterns in sightings such as the types of crafts and duration of the sightings\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this study, we will be limiting our research to the United States (Washington D.C and Puerto Rico). We will also be using the term \"UAP\" moving forward as that is the current terminology used in government and media discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this information cannot prove that extraterrestrial life is behind these UAPs, understanding patterns behind them could help the public stay more vigilant and help our government know how best to monitor and study such phenomena in the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the United States from 1910-1949, thousands of UAP cases were documented across the country. A majority of these cases were recorded in California and in the summer months of June-August. The most likely time to see a UAP is between 8-10 pm with sightings lasting anywhere between less than a second to multiple hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe the largest potential issue in this data set is the reliance on eyewitness testimony. Data could be skewed given different recording methods, number of witnessess, time of recording, etc. However that does not mean it does not give valuable insight into where and when these UAPs will be seen in the future. Information from this study could help the U.S government and other researchers track potential movements, focus areas of UAP studies, and develop methods for efficient response time to unidentified aerial phenomena."
