# Sprint_4_Project
Repository used for TripleTen Sprint 4 Project
This project aims to creat a web application exploring some basic trends regarding global UFO sightings from 1910 to 2014. This data set was obtained from : https://mavenanalytics.io/

UFO (unidentified flying objects) or UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena) as the are now called are terms used to describe "any apparent object in the sky that canâ€™t be identified and classified as an object or phenomenon already known" (Petrescu, 1). While some of these can be accredited to phenomena such as weather balloons or aircrafts, others are harder to explain by conventional means. These sightings are often linked to extraterrestrials and alien life. While this topic is controversial and discussion is widespread even throughout the United States government, data does exist to support the existence of UAPs and patterns in the experiences seen.

This study aims to: Identify potential patterns in UAP sightings such as:

Places with high numbers of sightings
Years/ times of the year when sightings are high
Patterns in sightings such as the types of crafts and duration of the sightings
For the purposes of this study, we will be limiting our research to the United States (Washington D.C and Puerto Rico). We will also be using the term "UAP" moving forward as that is the current terminology used in government and media discussions.

While this information cannot prove that extraterrestrial life is behind these UAPs, understanding patterns behind them could help the public stay more vigilant and help our government know how best to monitor and study such phenomena in the future.

to complete this project the libraries pandas, matplotlib, streamlit, plotly, and numpy were used
